# UXUI-Chatbot

This is the very first app I built from scratch. Did not even know about .gitignore, so I'll leave my node_modules folder as a reminder of how far I've gone.

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* uncomment cleverbot function if you want to use cleverbot. (Don't forget to comment out botRespondTo function if you do that)

## Running / Development

Just run index.html.

## Future plan

I'm interested in making the bot a lot smarter. One day I hope to use an NLP to make a self-learning chatbot.
